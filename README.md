## TODOs

### whatsapp group agent

- [ ] **dynamic chat context:** initial chat context is 6 most recent messages.
      what if we dynamically loaded it according to if the bot recently replied,
      etc. i.e. if there's a current active "conversational" set of
      back-and-forths, extend chat context up to 20 messages.
- [ ] **opaque tool calls:** hide invocations of `send_message_history_link`
      from the bot when loading messages.
