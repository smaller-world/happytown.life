# The {CachedProvider} wraps another provider (or {ProviderList}) and caches
# the response from it.
#
# The default cache store is a instance-specific hash that lives for the
# entire duration of the instance. If you want to share hash between
# instances, pass your own hash-like object. Just remember to not allow this
# cache to grow without bounds, which a shared hash would do.
#
# Not found assets are not cached currently, but it's possible to extend this
# class in the future if there is a need for it. Remember this if you have
# providers with very slow failures.
#
# The cache store must accept {Roadie::Stylesheet} instances, and return such
# instances when fetched. It must respond to `#[name]` and `#[name]=` to
# retrieve and set entries, respectively. The `#[name]=` method also needs to
# return the instance again.

# This provider acts a bit like a pipeline in normal UNIX parlour by enabling
# you to make changes to the requested path. Some uses of this include:
#
#   * Convert absolute URLs into local filesystem paths.
#   * Convert between external DNS name into internal naming.
#   * Changing path structure of filenames.
#   * Removing digests from filenames.
#   * Handle query string logic.
#   * Skipping known-bad paths.
#
# There might be other useful things you could use it for. The basic premise
# is that a path is sent in to this provider, maybe modified and then passed
# on to the "upstream" provider (or {ProviderList}).
#
# If the block returns {nil} or {false}, the upstream provider will not be
# invoked and it will be treated as "not found". This makes it possible to
# use this provider as a filter only.
